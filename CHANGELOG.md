### App commit number correction
- Derive the displayed app commit number from the deployment workflow run number, preserving the app numbering offset so push run 183 is app commit 267 and push run 184 is app commit 268.
- Do not use the repository-wide Actions workflow-run total as the app commit number.

### App commit numbering
- Show the app commit number in Changelog entries instead of the individual GitHub Actions push-run number.
- Keep failed, cancelled, queued and in-progress attempts in the same app-commit sequence. The weekly releases redesign is app commit 267.

### Weekly releases redesign
- Redesign “This week’s releases” as a compact, date-led weekly schedule with release counts, time chips, clearer title hierarchy and saved-platform labels.
- Group episodes of the same title airing on the same day/time into a single tappable card to avoid long repeated-title lists.
- Improve empty-day states, dates-to-be-announced grouping, mobile spacing and keyboard focus visibility.

# Changelog

## 2026-10-06

### Changelog and push status history
- Rename the app's “What's new” menu and dialog to **Changelog**.
- Show every repository push in the Changelog, including failed, cancelled, timed-out, skipped, queued, and in-progress pushes rather than only successful changes.
- Resolve each push's GitHub Actions result by commit SHA and preserve the actual push number, using status-specific wording such as “Failed push 178”, “Cancelled push 189”, and “Push 190” for a successful push.
- Keep the existing successful deployment refresh notification separate from the push-status history.

### Deployment status notifications
- Add a private in-app notification to your account only whenever a push/change is sent — including successful, failed, cancelled, or otherwise unsuccessful deployment attempts.
- The notification tells you the push/commit and its outcome so a failed or ineffective change is immediately identifiable.
- Keep the existing successful-deployment refresh signal separate from the new status notification.
- Fix the WebKit smoke check so the known mocked Supabase pin CORS diagnostic does not incorrectly fail an otherwise passing browser run.

### Verified fix
- Keep a TV episode in the upcoming/current release timeline for 24 hours after its actual air timestamp even after TVMaze advances `nextEpisodeDate` to the following episode.
- Use the stored `scheduledEpisodeReleases` metadata as the post-air retention source, with regression coverage for both the upcoming card and current timeline.

### Verified fixes
- Connected the existing root `apply_fixes.py` on `main` to the GitHub Pages deployment workflow.
- The fix script now targets the repository's current split source files rather than assuming all code is inside `index.html`.
- Allow pinch-to-zoom by removing the `user-scalable=no` viewport restriction.
- Preserve episode progress when release/episode metadata for the current season is unavailable instead of clamping progress to zero.
- Make `mergeLibraries` timestamp ties deterministic so the first/cloud record wins an equal-timestamp collision.
- Add `90dvh` to the editor modal height so Safari's dynamic toolbar does not clip the modal.
- The script is idempotent and verifies all four fixes on every deployment.

- 2026-10-06: Fixed Changelog push-status rendering so every result keeps exactly one actual push number with the correct status-specific wording: failed/cancelled pushes use `Failed push N` / `Cancelled push N`, while successful pushes use `Push N`.
